\subsection*{Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium: Natural Selection (\numpoints\ points)}

This exercise will look at how \textbf{natural selection}, both positive
and negative, can alter genetic variation in a population. We'll
continue to look at a single locus with two haplotypes (\emph{A} and
\emph{a}). Natural selection can act on both the genotype and the
phenotype. For this exercise, we will assume that natural selection is
acting only on the phenotype but that the phenotype is determined
entirely by the genotype. In other words, the environment does not
affect the phenotype. When this is so, natural selection is effectively
acting directly on the genotype through the phenotype. Later in class,
we'll consider the relative contribution of the environment on the
phenotype.

\begin{questions}

\question[1]
What do think positive natural selection, or simply
\textbf{positive selection}, means? Similarly, what do you think
\textbf{negative selection} means?
\vspace*{\stretch{1}}

\question[1]
Based on your reading and group discussion, define
\textbf{relative} \textbf{fitness}.

\question[1]
Describe the relationship between natural selection and
relative fitness.

\question[1]
Do you think you can predict the number of generations it would take for a beneficial mutation to become fixed in a population? Explain
\vspace*{\stretch{1}}

\fullwidth{%
\textbf{Relative fitness} is represented by \emph{\textbf{w}}, which can
vary from 0 (no fitness) to 1 (maximum fitness). In models like the HWE,
one genotype is assumed to have the highest fitness. The other genotypes
may have equal or lower fitness. For example, the \emph{AA} genotype may
have the highest fitness, so \emph{w} = 1.0. \emph{Aa} may have a lower
relative fitness (\emph{w} = 0.9) and \emph{aa} may have the lowest
relative fitness (\emph{w} = 0.8). In previous HWE exercises, fitness
was assumed to be equal (\emph{w} = 1) for each genotype to satisfy the
assumption of no natural selection. We will now see how fitness
differences among genotypes affects the genetic variation of
populations.

Assume \emph{N}\textsubscript{e} = 10,000 and a starting
frequency for Haplotype \emph{A} of 0.3. The fitness of genotype
\emph{AA} is \emph{w} = 1, the fitness of genotype \emph{Aa} is \emph{w}

on the graph below how the frequency of Haplotype \emph{A} will change
in the population in response to selection. All other assumptions of
HWE, except for infinite population size, are met. (Mental question:
will drift be significant?)

Without addition information we cannot determine whether natural
selection is acting positively on \emph{A} or negatively on \emph{a}. We
do know, however, that the \emph{AA} genotype has the selective
advantage in the population because it has the highest fitness. The
relative fitness difference between the genotype with the highest
fitness (\emph{w} = 1.0) and genotypes with lower fitness is called the
\textbf{selection} \textbf{coefficient} (or the \textbf{strength of
selection}), represented by \emph{\textbf{s}}. In the first simulation,
the relative fitness of \emph{Aa} was 0.75, so the selection coefficient
relative to \emph{AA} was \emph{s} = 1 -- 0.75 = 0.25.

\question
Describe the results and compare them to your four
predictions.

\newpage

\fullwidth{%
Given our starting assumptions, Haplotype \emph{A} had a 0.005
probability of going to fixation due to genetic drift alone (0.5\%
chance). But, the slight selective advantage of the \emph{AA} genotype
increased the probability of fixation to about 0.02. So, instead of
fixation in about 1 of every 200 populations (on average), the slight
selective advantage led to fixation in about 2 of every 100 populations
(2\%).
}%end fullwidth

\fullwidth{%
Will natural selection always override the effects of genetic drift? No.
Even in the above simulation, genetic drift was still a factor but
selection increased the chances of fixation for the genotype with the
selective advantage. If the effective population size is small enough,
or if the strength of selection is very weak, drift will have a greater
effect than selection. If \emph{s} \textless{}\textless{}
1/(4\emph{N}\textsubscript{e}) then drift will have a greater effect
than selection on genetic variation in the population.
}%end fullwidth

\fullwidth{%
For example, if \emph{N}\textsubscript{e} is 50, then the selection
coefficient must be greater than about 0.005 (= 1/200) or genetic drift
will be the principle cause of haplotype frequency change.
}%end fullwidth


\question[2]
What should be the strength of selection in a population of
\emph{N}\textsubscript{e} = 100 to overcome the effects of genetic
drift? If \emph{N}\textsubscript{e} = 10,000 or 50,000? Show your work.

	\part $N_e =$ 50,000: \ifprintanswers\textbf{0.000005}\fi\vspace*{\stretch{1}}
\end{parts}

\fullwidth{%
You must remember that genetic drift is present in populations of all
sizes. When considering both genetic drift and natural selection, drift
is more prevalent in small populations unless selection is strong. As
population size increases, even weak selection can override the effects
of genetic drift because 1/(4\emph{N}\textsubscript{e}) will be very
small.
}%end fullwidth

\fullwidth{%
This relationship between genetic drift and natural selection can have
important consequences in natural populations. For example, a beneficial
mutation in a population of an endangered species (very small
\emph{N}\textsubscript{e}) that increases survivorship in marginal
habitat is more likely to be lost due to genetic drift. In contrast,
even a slight selective advantage for resistance to antibiotics in a
population of disease-causing bacteria may spread rapidly throughout the
population in relatively few generations because the effective
population sizes of bacteria tend to be extremely large.

\fullwidth{%
\textbf{Heterozygotes: advantages and disadvantages}

In a few cases, individuals that are heterozygous at a locus have a
selective advantage over individuals that are homozygous at that locus.
That is, \emph{w} = 1.0 for \emph{Aa} and \emph{w} \textless{} 1 for
\emph{AA} and \emph{aa}. This is called \textbf{heterozygote advantage}.
Heterozygote advantage is also called overdominance or heterosis but I
prefer heterozygote advantage because it is self-descriptive.
