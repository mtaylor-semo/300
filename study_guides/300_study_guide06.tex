\section{Concepts}

You should \emph{write} clear and concise answers to each question in the Concepts section.  The questions are not necessarily independent.  Think broadly across lectures to see ``the big picture.'' 

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Natural selection requires a correlation between parental and offspring genotypes, and a correlation between a phenotypic trait and fitness. Explain why these correlations are \emph{necessary} for natural selection to occur.
	
	\item Tell mathematically and in words how relative fitness is obtained from absolute fitness.
	
	\item Be sure you can read and interpret $w_{11}, W_{11}$, etc.~in context. For example if you read $w_{12} > w_{22}$, you should understand and be able to explain what that relationship means.
	
	\item Explain the selection coefficient.\marginnote{Strength of selection is an synonym.} Be able to interpret and diagram an illustration of weak and strong $s$ relative to a reference genotype.
	
	\item Given values of $p$ and $s$, be able to calculate the predicted frequency change $\left(\Delta p\right)$ for an allele.
	
	\item Be able to use calculations of $\Delta p$ to show how $s$ affects the rate of adaptation in a population.
	
	\item Explain how relative fitness of genotypes is affected by alleles that are dominant or recessive, relative to an allele that is neither.
	
	\item Explain how a selective sweep for a beneficial mutation could lead to an increased frequency of a weakly detrimental allele due to hitchhiking.
	
	\item Briefly explain balancing selection. Explain why balancing selection maintains genetic polymorphism in a population.
	
	\item Explain the difference between positive and negative frequency-dependent selection. Which maintains genetic polymorphism in a population and why? Which eliminates genetic polymorphism from a population and why? Be able to recognize examples of each given the proper context. (In other words, don't just memorize the examples given in class. )
	
	\item Repeat the previous question for overdominance and underdominance. 
	
	\item What does it mean to say heterozygote advantage? What do you think would be a corresponding term in the context of underdominance?
	
	\item Purifying selection should remove detrimental mutations from a population but detrimental mutations remain in populations of most species. Explain why.
	
	\item Explain mutation load and how it affects mean fitness of a population.
